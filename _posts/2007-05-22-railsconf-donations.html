<p>During RailsConf 2007, the organizers encouraged the community to donate money for good causes.  I just read that the total so far is $33,000.  That is a great showing from the Ruby on Rails community.  Great job!</p>
<p>They may still be accepting donations, so <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/donate/">please help out</a>.</p>
