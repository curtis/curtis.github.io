<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class="summary">
    I’m a Phoenix-based <a rel="external" href="https://millarian.com">Ruby on Rails developer</a> and co-founder of Velocity Labs, a <a rel="external" href="http://velocitylabs.io">Ruby on Rails ewb application development</a> company.</p>
<p>    I have a MS in Computer Science and have written software professionally since 2001. I've worked at small agile companies and large bureaucratic companies and found that my true passion lies in working in and around startup companies. With Flatterline, I get a chance everyday to help <a href="/tag/phoenix-startups">Phoenix startups</a> realize their vision.</p>
<p>  While I work mostly in <a href="/category/programming/ruby-on-rails/">Ruby on Rails</a>, I'm also expanding my skill set into iPhone development as that is something often requested by the startups with which we work.

<p class="summary">
        Flatterline is a kick ass web development company in Phoenix, AZ that specializes in helping early stage startups. We work primarily as <a rel="external" href="http://velocitylabs.io">Ruby on Rails developers</a>.</p>
<p>        We work closely with startup founders to discuss, prioritize and implement software features in order for them to reach their goal, whether that's generating revenue or receiving additional funding. We're also often asked to participate in investor or partner pitches to provide technical details if requested.</p>
<p>        We value working code more than large documents and to that end we try to have something visible the first day we begin development. After that, we try to deploy the application as features are complete in order to gather feedback as quickly as possible. Sometimes, we'll deploy several times per day. We find this is the easiest way for startup founders to see their idea take shape. It also provides a convenient means of giving potential investors and partners a sneak peek into the progress being made on the idea.

<p class="summary">
        During this time, I taught myself Ruby and Ruby on Rails technologies by exploring several different ideas for web applications. I also entered into a short-term contract to create a student tracking application for a community college wellness center.</p>
<p>        Additionally, I worked for several months for a client that was building an <acronym title="electronic medical record">EMR</acronym> system using Ruby on Rails and JavaScript with a MySQL backend. On the JavaScript side, we used the Ext JavaScript library to provide a highly usable and functional <acronym title="graphical user interface">GUI</acronym>.</p>
<p>        During my time at this client I transitioned their SQL files into Rails migrations, developed a portion of the system to manage patients once they arrive at the facility, completely refactored the existing schema, rewrote the existing Rails views to integrate with Ext (including wrapping much of the Ext functionality into Rails helpers), rewrote a significant portion of the existing code base, integrated many plugins (including a customized acts_as_paranoid), and generally made both the code and product a whole lot nicer.</p>
<p>        By the end of my time at this client, we were developing on edge Rails and implementing a RESTful architecture for the product. I also worked to introduce a more agile approach to development including pair-programming (which worked great!).
