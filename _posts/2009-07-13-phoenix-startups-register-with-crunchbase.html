<p>Many people in Phoenix don't know about <a rel="external" href="http://crunchbase.com">CrunchBase</a>, the free database of technology companies, people, and investors brought to you by TechCrunch. If Phoenix startups, technology companies, people, investors and service providers (non-tech: lawyers, PR, etc.) add themselves to CrunchBase, we could get a better idea about who's in Phoenix, what they're doing and how we, as a community, can help them succeed.</p>
<p>I've heard talk from multiple people in the last few weeks about independent initiatives for creating something similar to this, but why not use what already exists? Even better, they have a <a rel="external" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/help/api">CrunchBase API</a>, so, if you want to build on top of it you can! Of course, first glance at the API seems pretty sketchy at the moment... However, I'm sure you could get a beta invite and help them work out the kinks :)</p>
<p>There's also a location based search, so if you were worried about that, take a look at this <a rel="external" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/maps/search?range=100&geo=Phoenix%2C+AZ">map of Phoenix companies</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fill in a form and bada-bing your company is submitted to CrunchBase, so why not do it now?</strong></p>
<p>HT <a rel="external" href="http://twitter.com/christingom">@ChrisTingom</a> for reminding me to talk about this.</p>
