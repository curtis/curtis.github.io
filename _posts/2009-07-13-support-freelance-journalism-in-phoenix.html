subtitle: "Help support Heat City, a local Phoenix, Arizona freelance news source by giving a donation."

<p>I recently saw a tweet by <a rel="external" href="http://twitter.com/nickmartin">Nick Martin</a>, a <a rel="external" href="http://heatcity.org">freelance journalist in Phoenix</a>, asking for donations for his online news outlet Heat City. They cover news stories that you may not hear through traditional media outlets and that's why I like it. That's also why I donated.</p>
<p>After donating I received a personal email from Nick telling me about Heat City, what they're working on and how much they appreciate my donation. Even better, he knew who I was and asked me how {{ site.company.name }} was going. That surprised me because we've never actually met or talked. It's that kind of attention to local happenings that sets Heat City apart.</p>
<p>They're only looking to raise $700 in the next 2 weeks. Seems like a small price to pay for something of great value. <strong>Will you show your support and donate?</strong></p>
<p>Also, if you have news stories or leads <a href="mailto:emailnickmartin@gmail.com">pass them along to Nick</a>.</p>
