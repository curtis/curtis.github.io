title: "TwitterBot Gem Released"
---
<p>Tonight, at one of our (in)famous hack-a-mania nights, we released a gem for accessing Twitter through <span class="caps">XMPP</span>. Read the full <a href="http://integrumbles.com/2008/6/12/get-your-twitter-on">release article</a> and then go get hacking!</p>

<p>I'm excited because not only did I have a hand in the creation of the twitter_bot gem, but I also helped in the development of <a href="http://twitterprops.com">Props &#38; Drops</a>, aka. TwitterProps, a Twitter application that uses this gem.  So If you want to see it in action, give someone props (or drops) via twitter:</p>

<p>props @username for doing something cool</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>drops @username for being a jerk</p>

<p>Go try it out!</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">DISCLAIMER</span></strong>: TwitterProps and twitter_bot only work when Twitter has their track feature enabled, which recently has been scarceâ€¦</p>
