title: "Supporting Phoenix Startups"
---
<p>Over the last few months I've been working and speaking with entrepreneurs, advisors and investors as <a rel="external" href="http://chrischandler.name">Chris Chandler</a> and I build Flatterline, <a rel="external" href="{{ site.company.url }}">a web development company</a> in Phoenix, Arizona. During these discussions, it became apparent to me that the <a href="https://millarian.com/tag/phoenix-startups">startup community in Phoenix</a> is elusive and scattered. Since {{ site.company.name }} is highly focused on assisting startups with their software development needs, it's in our best interest to have an active, engaged and thriving community of entrepreneurs in Phoenix.</p>
<p>To that end, we've initiated a few events, and promoted others, to help coalesce the community. The first two events we've helped organize in Phoenix are not new; instead, they build upon existing initiatives by other communities of entrepreneurs around the world. They are proven ideas that have helped entrepreneurial communities to come together and grow.</p>
<h3>Phoenix Startup Drinks</h3>
<p>This event is intended to bring Phoenix startups together over drinks to discuss what they're working on, what they need help with and what they can do for each other.</p>

<h3>Phoenix OpenCoffee Club</h3>
<p>This event is much like Startup Drinks, but is for the early risers and coffee drinkers amongst us. It is intended to bring Phoenix entrepreneurs and investors together in an informal setting to discuss ideas and collaborate.</p>
