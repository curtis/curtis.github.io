<p><a href="http://www.christopherirish.com/">Chris Irish</a> and I have been hard at work making another release of <a href="http://freebootr.com">Freebootr</a>. We released it in mid-December with improved search and speed as well as a redesigned look and feel. Shortly after this release, we got a write up in the <a href="http://phoenix.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/12/22/focus6.html">Phoenix Business Journal</a>.</p>
<p>To date we have over 23,000 listings in 17 states. We're excited about the progress made on Freebootr and hope that 2009 continues the progress we've made in waste reduction. We hope you're excited too! We'd love to hear your thoughts or ideas about Freebootr, so please <a href="mailto:contact@freebootr.com">send us your feedback</a>.</p>
