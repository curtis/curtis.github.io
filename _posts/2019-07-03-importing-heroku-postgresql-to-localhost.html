title: "Importing Heroku PostgreSQL to localhost"

<p>
  It can sometimes be useful to operate against a more robust set of data on your local machine, especially when you're seeing different behavior locally vs on staging/production. If you're using Heroku with PostgreSQL, this can be very easy with the right set of commands.
</p>

<p>
  From the root directory of your project request that a new backup be created on Heroku.
<p>

{% highlight shell %}
  heroku pg:backups:capture
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  NOTE: If you have more than one Heroku app available, then you'll need to specify which one by using the `-a APP` or `-r REMOTE` options.
</p>

<p>
  You should now have a backup available to you, which you'll want to download to your local machine. Heroku also offers a command to help with grabbing the latest backup. Again, you may need to specify the app or remote here.
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
  heroku pg:backups:download
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Finally, you can restore this backup (<code>latest.dump</code>) to your local PostgreSQL database. This will overwrite the database specified, so be cautious.
</p>

{% highlight shell %}
  pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -h localhost -d [DATABASE NAME] latest.dump
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  Happy debugging!
</p>
