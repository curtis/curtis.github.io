<p>So, I got this error today and it took me a few minutes to track down why. Seems like the kind of thing that might be interesting to people. I'm using nginx on a project and this error was being thrown by nginx, not by Rails.  What could be the cause?</p>
<h3>Nginx configuration and <span class="caps">REST</span></h3>
<p>Do you have something in your nginx config file that looks like this?</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="sh">if (-f $request_filename) {
  break;
}</code></pre></p>
<p>Basically, render an existing, static file directly, aka. bypass Rails. This is great, we don't incur the overhead of hitting Rails for static files, including cached files, right?  Wrong.</p>
<p>You see, with <span class="caps">REST</span>, your <span class="caps">URL</span> will be the same for a <strong><span class="caps">POST</span> to create</strong> as it will for a <strong><span class="caps">GET</span> to index</strong>.  For example, viewing the users index and creating a user:</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="sh">GET  /users &lt;= user's index
POST /users &lt;= create a user</code></pre></p>
<p>See the problem?</p>
<p>That's right, if you cache the user's index using a technique like <code>caches_page</code> then you have a static file (e.g., users.html) that matches regardless of the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> method. Therefore, it will bypass rails and attempt to serve the static file on a <span class="caps">POST</span> request, resulting in a 405 error. Whew!</p>
<h3>Caching with nginx</h3>
<p>So what do you do? I don't know. But this is what I did and I hope it helps.  Add the following to your nginx config prior to the serving of static files.</p>
<p>
<pre><code class="sh">if ($request_method != GET) {
  proxy_pass http://foobar;
  break;
}</code></pre></p>
<p>Uh, where <code>foobar</code> is the name you specified in the upstream declaration in the nginx config. This should pass any non-GET request to Rails immediately since we don't want to statically serve files for anything other than <span class="caps">GET</span>.</p>
