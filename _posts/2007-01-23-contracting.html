<p>I am about to end my first contract position with the <a href="http://www.gilaccc.org/Wellness%20Center.htm">Gila Community College Wellness Center</a> in Arizona.  I have been developing an internal web-based application for them and will deliver it at the end of this week.  I was able to convince them to let me use <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> for the development with a <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL Database</a>.  Essentially these are the same technologies I have been using on my startup.</p>
<p>Have I mentioned recently that I love Ruby on Rails?  No?  Okay, ummm… I love it.  For the startup I was concentrating on pushing features as quickly as possible and I was least concerned about formal testing.  In a contract position though I needed to really delve into how to test my code using the built in functionality provided with Ruby on Rails.  With a little help from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Development-Rails-Dave-Thomas/dp/0977616630/sr=8-1/qid=1169605074/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-2305102-2783144?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">Agile Web Development with Rails book</a>  I was testing in no time.  The testing framework in place makes it very easy to develop and run your tests.  Eventually I will need to go back through my startup code and add tests.  I was dreading that activity, but now it seems like it will be easier than I expected.  Of course, I am a bad programmer for letting it lapse in the first place… baaaad programmer!</p>
<p>Testing is one of those activities that is often overlooked during the course of your academic career.  When I completed my BS in Computer Science at <a href="http://www.arizona.edu">the <acronym title="University of Arizona">UofA</acronym></a> testing was not on the curriculum.  Our introduction to testing was when some teaching assistant developed a rudimentary suite of tests to grade our program.  They usually released some of them so you could get a feel for how well you had coded, but your grade was based on a super-set of the tests you were given.  Now that I look back on it they probably knew only a little more than us about testing, but of course they needed something to base a grade on.  I remember several times when people discovered errors in the TA's tests!</p>
<p>There were very few people who developed their own tests.  In fact, the philosophy I heard espoused most often from students and faculty was &#8220;Just get it working!&#8221;  There was one guy though, Tal, who created tests and, compassionately, allowed others to test against them.  He was a special case though as he was light years ahead of anyone else I knew in that program.  Only later did I find out that he was a <a href="http://www.uschess.org/news/bio/shaked.php">chess grandmaster</a>...  He eventually went on to pursue an advanced degree at <a href="http://www.washington.edu" title="University of Washington">UW</a> and currently works at Google.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have wanted to try test-driven development for a while, but keep putting it off.  Why?  Why is it so hard to do?  I think I have been conditioned to think of tests as a secondary activity.  Sadly, this looks to be a difficult habit to overcome.  Anyone have any suggestions for these testing withdrawal symptoms?  Any advice is appreciated.</p>
