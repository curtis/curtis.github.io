<p>It has been about three months since I started this project.  Here is a recap of what I have accomplished:</p>
<ul>
<li>I learned the Ruby language and the Rails framework.  I know I still have a lot to learn, but I am far enough along that I'm feeling comfortable in my ability.</li>
<li>I created an executive summary for the business.  This helped me to nail down just what I was thinking for the site and got me to focus on how the business would work.</li>
<li>I created a depth-first prototype of the site.  Of course, being a prototype it was hacked together, but contained about eight major features that I would like to see in the real site.  Not pretty, but functional…mostly.</li>
<li>I successfully released an alpha version of the site and gathered a group of testers to try it out.  Based on their feedback, I released several minor releases for bug fixes and improvements. All of this served to improve the site.</li>
<li>I successfully released a second version of the alpha containing bug fixes, improvements and one new major feature.  This is currently being tested by my group and I have already received some good feedback.</li>
<li>I have compiled a large feature list to be implemented on the site and I am progressing steadily toward the next version.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been having a great time working on this.  I have learned an enormous amount in a very short time and discovered a language that I enjoy very much.  I have told myself from the beginning that, if nothing else came of this site, I would learn a lot in the process.  Now that things have gotten so far along, I don't want knowledge to be the only thing I get from this.  I want to see this site be <b>used</b>.  I want to see the membership grow and the community thrive.  I want it to succeed in it's purpose…</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I am almost at the end of my rope financially.  I am worried that I will not be able to see this through to the end that I would like.  That's why it's time I seriously pursued venture capital…</p>
<p>I believe I am in a good position to attain some level of funding, but the world of investment seems so foreign and mysterious to me.  I have read <i>a lot</i> about funding, but I still regard it as a strange and wily beast.  However, I am going to try in earnest.  I believe that having a functional site will help.  It shows that this is more than an idea and I have taken serious steps to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Tomorrow begins my focus on capital.  This means that the site will take a backseat for a couple of days so I can get down to business.  Please share your advice on pursuing venture capital in the comments.  I would love to hear other peoples experiences.</p>
