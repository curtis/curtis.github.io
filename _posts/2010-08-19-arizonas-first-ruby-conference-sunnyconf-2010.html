<p>It started as an impromptu chat about getting more Ruby sessions into events like Desert Code Camp. A small group of rubyists met in the courtyard of DeVry University after the lunch break and kicked around some ideas. It seems like only yesterday that the group, which represented about 5 Phoenix companies, was asked "<strong>Wait... what about having a Ruby conference in AZ?</strong>" Now, that idea has blossomed into a full-fledged <a rel="external" href="http://sunnyconf.com">regional Ruby conference, SunnyConf 2010</a>.</p>

<p>SunnyConf is a single-track, one day conference taking place Sept. 25th in Phoenix. There will be 8 speakers and a keynote, as well as lightning talks. There will also be time after the conference set aside for hacking. We've managed to pull together a great group of rubyists to share their knowledge. The speakers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ashkenas.com">Jeremy Ashkenas</a> (Keynote)</li>
<li><a href="http://hashrocket.com/people/view/les-hill/">Les Hill</a> &amp; <a href="http://hashrocket.com/people/view/jim-remsik/">Jim Remsik</a> of <a href="http://hashrocket.com">HashRocket</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blog.headius.com/">Charles Nutter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/bmizerany">Blake Mizerany</a></li>
<li>and <a rel="external" href="http://sunnyconf.com/#speakers">more</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find all of the date, time and location information in the widget to the right. You can also visit the <a rel="external" href="http://sunnyconf.com">official SunnyConf website</a> or just jump straight over to Eventbrite to <a rel="external" href="http://sunnyconf.eventbrite.com">register for SunnyConf</a>.</p>
<p>Late September is a great time to visit Phoenix! If you live nearby (e.g., Southern California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, etc.) then we're only a short drive, and an even shorter flight, away. If you're outside of that area, we have a major international airport, and plane tickets should be pretty cheap :)</p>
<p>I encourage you to come out to Arizona in September to learn, hack and meet other rubyists. <strong>I hope to see you at the conference!</strong></p>
