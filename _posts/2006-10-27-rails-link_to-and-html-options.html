<p>Just a small thing, but I needed to know how to do this and it took me a while to find.  Hopefully this will help someone else out.</p>
<p>In <span class="caps">HTML</span>, we might declare a link like so</p>

{% highlight html %}
<a title="Example" href="/controller/action">Click Here!</a>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, in Ruby on Rails, we want to declare a link, so we use the built in <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#M000378">link_to</a> method like this</p>

{% highlight erb %}
<%= link_to "Click Here!", :controller => "controller", :action => "action" %>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Hmmmâ€¦ how do we squeeze a title in there?  Luckily, the third parameter to <code>link_to</code> is a hash of <span class="caps">HTML</span> options.</p>

{% highlight erb %}
<%= link_to "Click Here!", {:controller => "controller", :action => "action"}, {:title => "Example"} %>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That should do it.  I feel like I still have so much to learn about Ruby on Rails, but the more I learn the more I <strong>want</strong> to learn!</p>
