title: "Ruby on Rails Testing - flash.now gotcha"
---
<p>I finished the test for my models and it went pretty well.  Today I started on the controller tests.  Shortly after starting I ran into some curious Ruby on Rails behavior.  I expected that the value of the flash variable would hold a certain value on an unsuccessful login attempt, but instead it was empty.  I ran the server and tested it manually and there it was 'Invalid login or password.' appeared as an error flash on the page.</p>
<p>Turns out that flash.now is cleared after it is rendered in the view.  That means you cannot get the value out in your tests.  There is a workaround though.  It is discussed on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowToTestFlash.Now/">Rails wiki</a> and on <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/2006/09/03/some-functional-testing-gotchas-in-ruby-on-rails/">Chu Yeow's Redemption in a Blog</a>.  So what is the workaround?</p>
<p>You must access the render viewed contents and look for the corresponding flash div.  For example, my code looked like the following:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
flash.now[:error] = 'Incorrect login or password.'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Which outputs a div into the view like this:</p>

{% highlight html %}
<div id='error'>Incorrect login or password.</div>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In your test you can use the <code>assert_tag</code> assertion to find the tag corresponding to the element you want.  Following our example above, we want to find a div tag with an id of error and contents should contain 'Incorrect login or password'.  This would look like:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
assert_tag :tag => 'div',
           :attributes => { :id => 'error' },
           :content => 'Incorrect login or password.'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The wiki also talks about using <code>@response.body</code> but I have not looked in to that yet.  I hope this helps.</p>
