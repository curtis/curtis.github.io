<p>I'll be attending <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/">RailsConf 2007</a> in Portland, OR this year.  Before I attend that, I thought it would be a good idea to view some of the information from last year.  I just finished <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson's keynote</a> from the 2006 conference.  <a href="http://www.scribemedia.org/2006/07/09/dhh/">Watch the video</a> and follow along with <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/lt-files/worldofresources.pdf">the slides</a>.  Good stuff!</p>
