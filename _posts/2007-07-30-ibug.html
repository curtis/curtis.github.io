<p>While creating <a href="/code/my-first-firefox-extension">Nads</a> I perused the source code of Firebug and noticed a directory called iBug.  What lies within you ask?  Why <a href="http://getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> for the iPhone of course.</p>
<p>It seems that <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/firebug_for_iph.php">iBug</a> is a small webserver that you run during development.  Placing a snippet of code into the head of pages you want to debug results in the page sending your log messages to the webserver, which forwards it into the Firebug console.  Joe also says it accepts requests from the browser and sends them to the iPhone for processing.  Very cool!</p>
