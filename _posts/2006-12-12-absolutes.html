<p>I talked with a friend recently about the use of absolutes in his vocabulary (e.g., never, always, impossible).  He is trying to reduce, or possibly eliminate them altogether.  I thought this was interesting because I have also thought about this and try not to use these words.</p>
<p>Absolutes are often associated with negative uses.  For instance, &#8220;I'll never do that&#8221; or &#8220;That is impossible&#8221; or &#8221; I always screw it up&#8221;.  We may not realize it but these thoughts and/or phrases could have a psychological effect on our self-esteem and actually cause what we said to become true.  If you think something is impossible or that you will screw it up, then you may not try in the first place.</p>
<p>I believe this kind of self-reflection is very beneficial to an individual.  Why don't you give it a try?  Let me know how it goes.</p>
