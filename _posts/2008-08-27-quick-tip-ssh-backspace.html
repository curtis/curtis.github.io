<p>I just ran across this <a href="http://jonathan.tron.name/2008/02/23/bad-key-bindings-over-ssh-from-a-mac">informative post by Jonathan Tron</a> that solved an annoyance I've had for a while: backspace not doing what I want when I use <span class="caps">SSH</span>.</p>
<h3>Change your Terminal Preferences</h3>
<ol>
<li>In Terminal, select Preferences | Settings | Advanced.</li>
<li>Select &#8216;Delete sends Ctrl-H'</li>
</ol>
<p>You may need to do this again if you change your terminal style.</p>
<h3>Specify a setting for nano</h3>
<ol>
<li>On your server open ~/.nanorc</li>
<li>Add &#8216;set rebinddelete'</li>
</ol>
<p>And now you should have backspace working correctly for at least a few thingsâ€¦</p>
