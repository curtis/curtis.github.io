<p>I need some new music to add to my collection. I've been listening to the same couple of CDs for the last 4 months. Please help me by recommending your current favorite!</p>
<p><strong>Leave your suggestions in the comments, I'll post my purchases here afterward.</strong></p>
<h3>The Purchase</h3>
<p>So after much time spent listening to samples from the recommendations I received, I settled on five albums. Three came from suggestions, one I've been wanting for a long time and one is the soundtrack of a movie my wife and I saw recently and loved. For better or worse, here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Fire: Funeral</li>
<li>The Decemberists: Picaresque</li>
<li>Feist: The Reminder</li>
<li>Okkervil River: Black Sheep Boy</li>
<li>Once: Soundtrack</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>
<p>Here is the list of all recommendations (that I didn't purchase, but maybe you will?):</p>
<ul>
<li>Atmosphere</li>
<li>Page France</li>
<li>The Mountain Goats</li>
<li>Bowerbirds</li>
<li>The National</li>
<li>The Hold Steady</li>
<li>Sufjan Stevens</li>
<li>Rodrigo y Gabriela: Rodrigo y Gabriela</li>
<li>José González: Veneer</li>

<li>Portishead</li>
<li>Abandoned Pools</li>

</ul>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who gave their 2¢ and feel free to keep the suggestions coming… I may buy more soon!</p>
