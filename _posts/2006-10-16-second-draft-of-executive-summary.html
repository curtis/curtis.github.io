<p>I spent a little time today refining my executive summary.  This is my second draft and I think that the feedback I have received so far has been very useful.  Thanks to everyone who reviewed and gave me feedback!  It's hard to know what to put into an executive summary.  How much detail is too much?  What should I concentrate on?  I opted to go with hand waving on numbers.  Instead, I went more in depth on the idea and what we will do during our execution that will separate us from the competition.  I think it is coming together nicely, but then again I'm biased.</p>
<p>I modeled my content after some documents I found at <a href="http://www.garage.com">Garage Technology Ventures</a>.  The first document, <a href="http://www.garage.com/resources/criticalfactors.shtml">Obtaining Funding</a>, describes the criteria by which VCs(Venture Capitalist) evaluate proposals.  What is your idea?  Does it solve a problem or expose an opportunity?  What is your competitive advantage and how will you retain it?  Do you have a working prototype with beta testers?  There is more to it than that of course, but I will leave the in depth reading to you.</p>
<p>The second document, <a href="http://www.garage.com/resources/writingexecsum.shtml">Writing an Executive Summary</a>, talks about writing an executive summary.  It lays out examples of the types of content that should be present in the executive summary.  It also argues that an executive summary should not be a single page as some VCs(Venture Capitalists) request, but should be more like two to three pages.  Mine is two and a half pages and I find it hard to imagine it condensed into a single page.  They have more content on their site that may be of use to you in the process of writing your executive summary.  I encourage you to check it out.</p>
<p><i>What websites, books, or other resources have you found to be helpful when pursuing funding?</i></p>
