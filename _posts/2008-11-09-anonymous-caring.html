<p>I received a wrong number text message today that stated</p>
<blockquote>
  U arent going to give up on me n stop talking to me bc things r complicated on my end, r u?
</blockquote>

<p>This person was trying to make a connection with someone who might not be talking with them anymore. They're having some difficulties in their relationship that I know nothing about, but if I didn't answer their fear/suspicion becomes reality. In essence, by not answering, the person they were trying to reach decided not to answer them. So I jotted off a quick reply</p>

<blockquote>
  Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.
</blockquote>

<p>Then added</p>

<blockquote>
  Good luck. I hope it works out.
</blockquote>

<p>I've often wondered if sometimes people just need to know that someone cares, even if it's anonymous, as in this case. It's easy to get wrapped up in ourselves and forget that other people need encouragement and support, too. There are little moments like these everyday that are easy to miss or ignore but that might have an impact in someone's life. <strong>Don't let those opportunities pass you by.</strong></p>
