<p>I've been at this for a couple of months now and I've started to notice some things.  When I tell people what I do (i.e., I work for no pay on a dot com that may not take off) I get a wide range of responses.  Here are some common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huh?</li>
<li>Congratulations! That is great!</li>
<li>Interesting…</li>
<li>Well…good luck with that.</li>
<li>Man, I wish I could take the leap… maybe I will… I should!... just as soon as I finish my current project…</li>
<li>You're doing what?!?  Are you crazy??</li>
<li>I hear it's another bubble…</li>
</ul>
<p>I get follow-up conversation almost every time; more questions than I usually care to answer, but I answer anyway.  It helps me to formulate more clearly how to communicate what I am doing and what my vision is.  I am surprised at how many people cannot hold a conversation about the Internet and the current technologies being used.  I realize that we really are in our own little world.  Despite the hundreds of blogs that are talking up a storm about Web 2.0 and the &#8220;new&#8221; Internet, most of the people I talk with are clueless about it.  Even when I tell them about it, they don't really get it and most don't care.</p>
<p>Makes me wonder if we, as developers, entrepreneurs, etc. are hyping this amongst ourselves, but the rest of the world could care less.  Kind of a collective &#8220;That's nice…&#8221; coming from potential users.  Fortunately, I'm persistent and have convinced several people of the benefits of these technologies and their uses.  A long road though…</p>
<p>Anyway, in my follow-up conversations, I usually get one or more of the following questions.  Depending on the person I am talking to it may be the first question or they may take a while leading up to it. Some people ask all three straight-away.  Regardless, they all want to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will you <b>make money</b> on it?</li>
<li><b>How much money</b> do you think you'll make?</li>
<li>When will you start <b>making money</b>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice a theme?  It's funny how interested people become when they are asking you about money.  I usually fend them off by explaining my theory about startups and money.  Considering this is my first (second really, but the first one was a practice run, right?) startup, this could be completely bunk information – your mileage will almost certainly vary.  The theory goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
If you concentrate on money first, you will fail.  If you concentrate on users and follow your vision for the site, you will eventually find a way to monetize, and <b>perhaps</b> not fail.
</blockquote>
<p>Another funny thing I have been getting a lot of lately reminds me of why I wear a &#8220;No, I will not fix your damn computer!&#8221; t-shirt (thanks Kim!) as a programmer.  In shifting from programmer to programmer/entrepreneur I now get many ideas for startups thrust at me by friends, family, and complete strangers.  It usually happens after a lull in the conversation.  Then they begin, &#8220;You know what's a great idea for a startup….&#8221; or &#8220;You know what you should do…&#8221;.  I think I will make a new t-shirt that says &#8220;No, I will not implement your damn idea for a startup!&#8221;  Actually, I'm making a list for the future… after all, I didn't sign an <span class="caps">NDA</span>….</p>
