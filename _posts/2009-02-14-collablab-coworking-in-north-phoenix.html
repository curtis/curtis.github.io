<h3>On Wednesday, February 18th, Phoenix is getting a new coworking space: CollabLab!</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.collablab.net/?p=160">Mike Montalvo</a>, the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of <a href="http://digitaltuning.com">automotive electronics company Digital Tuning</a> is opening up two of the four rooms in Digital Tuning's office suite as shared space for creative collaboration. Mike's vision for CollabLab is to provide a space in North Phoenix where people can escape from the isolation of working from home.</p>
<blockquote>I see CollabLab as place for people in north Phoenix to connect. It’s a medium to connect thinkers with…doers so they can accomplish the unthinkable. Together they can work towards a common goal, be it a better recipe or the next web startup. – Mike Montalvo</blockquote>
<p>And CollabLab isn't just technology oriented. Mike wants to foster an environment in which entrepreneurs of all kinds can meet, collaborate and thrive.</p>
<blockquote>While there is no doubt tech will be a hot topic, I don’t want to limit CollabLab to just technology. If a chef wants to collaborate with taste testers to improve the recipe, why not? There is no reason coworking spaces have to be tech oriented. – Mike Montalvo</blockquote>
<p>It appears that CollabLab already has several full-time members, but they need the support of the Phoenix community to make this a successful endeavor. Here are some things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/collablab">CollabLab on Twitter</a></li>
<li>Visit the <a href="http://collablab.net">CollabLab coworking website</a></li>
<li>Attend the <a href="http://www.collablab.net/?p=201">CollabLab grand opening</a> on Wednesday, February 18th</li>
<li>Tell your friends, retweet, write a blog post… share the love Phoenix!</li>
</ul>
<p>Please spread the word about this space and if you know someone interested in sharing a creative, collaborative environment with some great people, direct them to CollabLab. When entrepreneurs like Mike and great ideas like CollabLab succeed, Phoenix and it's inhabitants benefit!</p>
