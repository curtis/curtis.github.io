<p>When I came back from RailsConf I realized how poor my local participation has been.  I've been in Phoenix for almost a year and I haven't been to a single local group meeting.  Shame on me :(.</p>
<p>But that all changed on Tuesday when I attended the <a href="http://refreshphoenix.org">Refresh Phoenix</a> meeting at <a href="http://inzacoffee.com">Inza Coffee</a> in Scottsdale.  The Refresh group is trying to create a &#8220;strong community of designers and developers.&#8221; Cool!</p>
<p>I was surprised by the turn out (in a good way) â€“ there were about 50 people there.  Of the people I talked with, most were designers.  They had about six demos from various groups on applications and ideas they were working on.  My favorite was probably <a href="http://jumpbox.com">JumpBox</a> because they demoed an app they created to help with setting up <span class="caps">SVN</span> and Trac in one fell swoop.  In fact, they did it live during the demo. They have some other ones you can check out on their <a href="http://www.jumpbox.com/jumpbox-applications/">applications page</a>.</p>
<p>It was a pretty good gathering of folks, but people just split afterwards.  I wanted to meet more locals and start forming a network, but was only able to talk with a few people.  Rumor has it that some people hit <a href="http://rockbottombrewery.com">Rock Bottom</a> after the meeting maybe next time.</p>
<p>I'm also going to attend the <a href="http://rubyaz.org">Phoenix Ruby User Group</a> and <a href="http://rubyaz.org">AZ on Rails</a> events this month.  I'm really interested in meeting people in the Phoenix area, so look me up if you go to either of those.</p></p>
