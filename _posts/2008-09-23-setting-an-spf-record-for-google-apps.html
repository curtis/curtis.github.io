<p>I recently noticed a lot of rejected emails coming from a production app that had just switched to send mail through Google Apps. For some reason Google felt we might be spammers, so it began rejecting our emails out-of-hand. We would continuously get the following error message:</p>
<p>
<pre>Technical details of permanent failure:
Message rejected.  See http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=69585 for more information.</pre></p>
<p>That wasn't very helpful, but with a little digging it led me to find out about something called an <acronym title="Sender Policy Framework">SPF</acronym> and convinced me that I should set this up. It was really easy and I suggest you do it if you're sending mail from your Ruby on Rails application through Google Apps (or some other means).</p>
<p>When using Google Apps, simply add a <span class="caps">TXT</span> record to your <span class="caps">DNS</span> settings with the following value:</p>
<p><strong>v=spf1 mx include:aspmx.googlemail.com &#126;all</strong></p>
<p>Note also that Google wants you to use include and specify all with a tilde(~), not a plus(+) or minus(-).</p>
<blockquote>
Publishing an <span class="caps">SPF</span> record that lacks include:aspmx.googlemail.com or specifying -all instead of ~all may result in delivery problems.
</blockquote>
<p>I also contacted Google to let them know of the error and if you start seeing this, be sure to let them know, too. Either that or setting the <span class="caps">SPF</span> record corrected our problem and we no longer get the rejected emailsâ€¦</p>
