<p>A few years ago I was fortunate to hear a keynote, at the <span class="caps">OOPSLA 2003</span> conference, by <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/">Lawrence Lessig</a> about an up-and-coming idea regarding copyright.  It was called <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a>.</p>
<p>At the time I thought his keynote speech was very good and the idea was intriguing.  As you can see, this blog is under a CC(Creative Commons) license.  I think that it is a worthy cause and hope that it continues to gain traction in the future.</p>
<p>I am also a big fan of Google as anyone who knows me can attest.  Google once again shows what it is made of with a <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2006/11/google-and-creative-commons.html">$30,000 donation</a> to the CC cause.  This comes during CC's annual fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>If you are interested in donating to CC, then click <a href="http://creativecommons.org/support/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, here is a video about Creative Commons and copyright.  It is also a good way to donate to the CC cause.  From the CC website</p>
<blockquote>
Revver attaches a short ad at the end of each video; when someone clicks on the ad, Revver splits the resulting revenue with the video's creator. It's usually a 50/50 split, but Revver is generously giving Creative Commons 100% of the money our videos make through the end of our fundraising campaign on December 31, 2006.
