<p>As you may have noticed, I am not located in Silicon Valley, yet I am pursuing a technology startup.  The NY Times ran a story entitled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/business/yourmoney/22digi.html?ex=1319169600&#38;en=bc0cc83c6bc39382&#38;ei=5088&#38;partner=rssnyt&#38;emc=rss">It’s Not the People You Know. It’s Where You Are.</a> . The premise is that you should be in Silicon Valley if you are a startup.</p>
<p>Of course, I disagree as do <a href="http://blog.webreakstuff.com/2006/10/no-need-for-the-valley/">others</a>.  What do <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>, <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a>, <a href="http://www.netvibes.com">Netvibes</a>, <a href="http://www.xwiki.com">Xwiki</a>, and <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">Feedburner</a> have in common? Hint: not Silicon Valley.  And those are just the ones I know about.  I'm sure there are others.</p>
<p>That's not to say a location in Silicon Valley would not be beneficial.  It certainly could be, but don't believe the hype that you <b>absolutely must</b> be located in the valley.  Take your idea and run with it wherever you are.</p>
