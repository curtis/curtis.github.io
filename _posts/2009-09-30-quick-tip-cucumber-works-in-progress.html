subtitle: How to use the Cucumber tagging feature to tag scenarios.
title: 'Quick Tip: Cucumber Works-in-Progress'

<p>After upgrading to the latest gems, including cucumber and webrat, I noticed a deprecation message when trying to run <strong>rake features</strong>. There are new rake tasks now for running cucumber features:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/194601.js"></script></p>
<p>So now, you can indicate which scenarios should pass and which are still be worked on, then run them separately if you like. Simply add some meta-data to your scenarios like this:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/194602.js"></script></p>
<p>This will tag the scenario as a test that should work. If you have a work-in-progress, simply tag with <strong>@wip</strong>.</p>
