<p>I'll be heading to <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008">RailsConf 2008</a> this week in beautiful Portland, OR.  I can't wait to be in one of my favorite cities again.  Especially because I'll not only be enjoying the city, but also learning from and interacting with the Rails community.  If you're going to be in Portland this weekend, then feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>This trip is brought to me by the awesomest rails development shop! And if you see any of the other Integremlins there, say &#8220;Hi&#8221;, you never know what could happen. That's what I did last year and now I get to work there building amazing Rails applications every day. Oh, and we have stickers.</p>
