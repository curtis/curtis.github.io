<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://chrischandler.name">Chris Chandler</a> and I started a podcast. Almost every Wednesday at <a href="http://hacknight.gangplankhq.com">hacknight</a> we were having interesting conversations ranging over a wide variety of topics. After listening to <a href="http://funanymore.com">Evo Terra</a> give a presentation on podcasting we decided to start recording these conversations and publish them for the benefit of humanity.</p>
<p>The name we chose for this project is <a href="http://personalityflatline.com">Personality Flatline</a> and you can <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/PersonalityFlatline">subscribe via <span class="caps">RSS</span></a> or <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=300489593">subscribe via iTunes</a>. Of course, you can always visit the site and catch up on recent episodes.</p>
<p>After the first recording session, which consisted of us talking about random stuff, we ran an experiment for two weeks where we talk about topics suggested by people attending hacknight. We'll be releasing those episodes over the next few weeks. We're interested in hearing your feedback on the show, so don't forget to leave us comments.</p>
