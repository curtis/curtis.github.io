title: "Growing a Small Business, One Person at a Time"
---
<p>At this morning's Phoenix OpenCoffee Club Meetup a discussion started around how to know when to bring on additional people in a small business and some of the tips for doing so.</p>

<p>As a small, <a rel="external" href="{{ site.company.url }}">Phoenix Rails development</a> company, {{ site.company.name }} was particularly interested in this discussion. I'd been discussing this same topic with <a rel="external" href="http://chrischandler.name">Chris Chandler</a> the day before as we sense an expansion on the horizon, but are hesitant to bring someone on full-time. Our major point of concern is being able to provide constantly for someone else while we're still figuring out our own business.</p>
<p><a rel="external" href="https://twitter.com/consumer">Jason Ayers</a> led the discussion and we came up with a few things to consider when growing a small business. Here are some of the things we discussed:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Know the difference between a contractor and an employee</strong> - Jason related that there have been several times that he was treated like an employee, but was classified as a contractor. As a small business this can get you into a heap of trouble if you misclassify people. Consult with an attorney...</li>
<li><strong>Build a network</strong> - Establish relationships with independent contractors that can help you out as needed. Even if you don't bring them on as full-time contractors or employees, you can supplement your workforce more easily</li>
<li><strong>Try before you buy</strong> - Bringing someone in on a trial basis as a contractor for a few months makes a lot of sense for a small business. You can't afford to hire the wrong people, so there's no need to rush into bringing someone into the company that's not a good fit. Additionally, you can limit their hours so that neither party is entirely reliant on the other</li>
<li><strong>If it's not right, don't hire</strong> - If someone isn't the right fit, then don't keep them on. You need to do what's best for your business and sometimes that can be hard, but necessary</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I thought it was a good discussion. Since I'm a new small business owner, I'd love to hear comments from other, more experienced business people.</p>
<p><strong>What wisdom do you have for small businesses in Phoenix?</strong></p>
