<p>While trying to use the oh-so-nifty <a href="/rails/discover-your-missing-specs">missing spec finder</a> on a recent project, I discovered that it was not working.  Hmmm… seems that somewhere along the way Rails added detection for existing constants and won't allow you to re-generate something.  Instead it calls <code>raise_class_collision</code>, which raises a <code>UsageError</code>. Damn them.</p>
<p>Anyway, to work around this for now, you can add the following somewhere (e.g., an initializer):</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rails_generator/base'
require 'rails_generator/commands'

module Rails
  module Generator
    module Commands
      class Create
        def raise_class_collision(class_name)
          # Do Nothing
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This should get around that inconvenience. Plus, you won't be exposed to nefarious suggestions like I was:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ rake spec:sync
  The name 'User' is either already used in your application or reserved by Ruby on Rails.
  Please choose an alternative and run this generator again.

  Suggestions:

exploiter
drug user
substance abuser
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Thanks Rails, you're so helpful! I just don't understand how it could have known I was building a Facebook clone for junkies…</p>
