<p>If you happen to see this error after upgrading your SliceHost account, be calm.</p>
<p>
<pre>ActionView::TemplateError (Define INLINEDIR or HOME in your environment and try again)</pre></p>
<p>The simple solution is to add an environment declaration to your environment/production.rb file:</p>
<p>
<pre>ENV['INLINEDIR'] = '/path/to/.ruby_inline'</pre></p>
<p>Once that was set, we were in business againâ€¦ whew!</p>
