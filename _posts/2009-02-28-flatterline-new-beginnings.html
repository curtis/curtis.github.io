---
<p>Today marks the end of a major chapter in my life: I've left my current employer. I'd worked there for about 18 months as a contractor, then a Ruby on Rails developer and finally as the technical lead. I've enjoyed my time there and learned a lot, but decided that now was the time to move on.</p>

<h3>Enter Flatterline</h3>

<p>And as one door closes another is opened. <a rel="external" href="http://chrischandler.name">Chris Chandler</a> and I have started a <a rel="external" href="{{ site.company.url }}">Phoenix web development company</a> called Flatterline (now {{ site.company.name }}). Our preferred niche is assisting startups in the initial development phase. We'll certainly consider other opportunities, but we prefer to work with startups ;)</p>

<h3>Our clients</h3>

<p>We're currently working with 2 amazing Phoenix startups to create the first version of their product. These startups are founded by passionate and talented people with the ability to execute. As we're allowed to tell more about them we will. We believe in the startups we're working with and want to promote them to help them succeed.</p>

<h3>What now?</h3>

<p>We're extremely excited to have this opportunity to create a new venture in Phoenix. Especially one that can help entrepreneurs in Phoenix, and elsewhere, realize their vision.</p>

<p>This has all literally happened in the last 2 1/2 weeks. We barely have an LLC let alone a website, etc., however, you can reach us through curtis or chris at flatterline.com.</p>

<p>So, here's to new beginnings, we look forward to hearing from you!</p>
