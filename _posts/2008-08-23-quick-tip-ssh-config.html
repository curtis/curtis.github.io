<p>It's easy to create shortcuts for all those servers you need to <span class="caps">SSH</span> into. There should be a file in your <code>.ssh</code> directory called <code>config</code>.  Simply add a few lines to this file and you can refer to those servers by their short name.</p>

<h4>Example (~/.ssh/config)</h4>
{% highlight bash %}
Host foo
  Hostname some.long.hostname.you.cannot.remember.com
  User myuser
  Port 1234
  {% endhighlight %}
<p>Now you can use your new host when you <span class="caps">SSH</span>.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh foo
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If you want to get even fancier, read the man page for additional options.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ man ssh_config
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Setup as many as you need and free yourself from <span class="caps">SSH</span> hostname hell!</p>
