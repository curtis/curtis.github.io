title: Migration Timestamps deleted_at Magic Field
---
<p>I was recently working on a project using edge rails and saw that it supported something like what used to be called <cite><a href="http://errtheblog.com/post/2381">sexy migrations</a></cite>. Basically, you can make your migration files look a whole lot cleaner.</p>

<h4>Before</h4>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.column :first_name, string
      t.column :last_name, string
      t.column :birthday, date
      t.column :created_at, datetime
      t.column :updated_at, datetime
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :users
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>After</h4>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string      :first_name, :last_name
      t.date        :birthday
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :users
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Looks much better doesn't it?  For what I was doing though, I wanted to use the <a href="http://ar-paranoid.rubyforge.org/">acts_as_paranoid</a> functionality to never delete anything.  The acts_as_paranoid plugin updates the row with a deleted_at timestamp and then filters out 'deleted' ones whenever it queries the database.  Of course, I could just add <code>t.datetime :deleted_at</code> to each table.  But instead of going back to the old way of doing things, I simply extended the built in timestamps functionality by placing the following in a file in the lib directory and then requiring it in the environment.</p>

<h4>lib/custom_schema_definitions.rb</h4>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
module ActiveRecord
  module ConnectionAdapters #:nodoc:
    class TableDefinition

      # Adds a deleted_at column when timestamps is called from a migration.
      def timestamps_with_deleted_at
        timestamps_without_deleted_at
        column(:deleted_at, :datetime)
      end

      alias_method_chain :timestamps, :deleted_at
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h4>config/environment.rb (add)</h4>

{% highlight ruby %}
require "custom_schema_definitions"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, we can run our migration as we did before and the <code>t.timestamps</code> line will also give us a <code>deleted_at</code> column.  Share your paranoid ramblings in the comments.</p>

<p><i>Note: I believe this only works in <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/EdgeRails">Edge Rails</a> for the moment as the new migrations and alias_method_chain are not present in the latest stable version of Rails.</i></p>
