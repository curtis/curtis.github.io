<p>"Art is God" is something I once heard <a rel="external" href="http://tysoncrosbie.com">Phoenix artist and photographer</a> Tyson Crosbie say during an informative talk entitled "What is art?" At the time, I didn't really know Tyson, but I'd been impressed with the Twitter avatars he was producing for the Phoenix community. Little did I know that he was much more than a photographer.</p>
<p>With the release of his first self-published book, <a rel="external" href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/243265/">Phoenix 20</a>, I was blown away. I ordered a copy of the book and even got it signed by Tyson. Since then we've become friends, and when he released his second book in the series, <a rel="external" href="http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/728463">Phoenix 21</a>, I'm happy to say I was one of the first to order.</p>
<p>These two books, and hopefully more to come, comprise a collection of fine art photography that I'm proud to have in my sparse collection of art. But what if you had a chance to have one of his rare, signed, 1 of 1 edition pieces hanging in your home? Well now you can.</p>
<p>Simply leave a comment on <a rel="external" href="http://lyingtotellthetruth.com/art/local-home-exhibit/">lying to tell the truth</a> or <a rel="external" href="http://twitter.com/?status=RT%20@tysoncrosbie:%20Want%20some%20beautiful%20fine%20art%20on%20your%20walls?%20%23phx%20Check%20this%20out:%20http://bit.ly/LAxXx%20%23L4t">tweet about it</a> using the #L4t hashtag.</p>
<p><strong>You only have until Friday, July 17th for a chance to win!</strong></p>
