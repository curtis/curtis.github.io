<p>I am a software engineer turned entrepreneur working on a stealth social networking startup.  And I'm looking for funding.  Oh… you have?  Well, it seems that scenarios like this are all too common.  So how did <em>I</em> find myself in this situation?</p>
<p>It all started in June 2006 when my best friend came for a post-graduation visit.  He informed me that he had an idea for a company and he was going for it.  Then he proceeded to offer me the chance to be a founding member.  For me, it seemed like a great opportunity.</p>
<p>At the time, I was planning a move to my current location and looking for a job in the area.  I liked his idea and I had kicked around the option of starting a company before he approached me.  After some debating I decided to do it.  And thus was born my first company…yes, I said first…</p>
<p>Needless to say, things did not work out.  But I did learn some valuable lessons.  These may be useful to other aspiring founders and I may expound on these under separate posts in the future. The company dissolved and I was left pondering my options.  Should I start a new company and continue my work?  Should I start a different company and throw away the three months of work I had already done?  Should I get a &#8220;real&#8221; job?</p>
<p>In the end I decided to start a new company.  I am already jobless and penniless, so why not go for it.  This blog will attempt to follow this phase of my life and may include posts on technical or business aspects, current news and events, or just random thoughts.  I look forward to writing it and I hope you will enjoy reading it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>, I am still working on getting my blog in order, so please let me know if you see anything amiss.</p>
