<p>As I stated in a previous post, I attended the <a href="http://2008.goruco.com">Gotham Ruby Conference</a> this past weekend in <span class="caps">NYC</span>.  It was a great time with many interesting talks.  The weather was amazing as well.  I don't want to spend a lot of time rehashing the conference because you can view the <a href="http://goruco2008.confreaks.com">GoRuCo 2008 presentations</a> for yourself, but I did want to mention a few things I got out of it.</p>
<p>Bryan Helmkamp gave an interesting introduction to story driven development using rspec and story runner.  This is something we've been talking about at Integrum, but haven't had a chance to use in a real setting yet.  Derek and I got to spend some time at the <a href="http://weplay.com">WePlay</a> offices (where Bryan works) and they showed us some of the stuff they're doing, including using story runner.  It was awesome to hear about their experiences and hopefully we'll get a chance to use it soon.</p>
<p>Next up was &#8220;Archaeopteryx: A Ruby <span class="caps">MIDI</span> Generator.&#8221; I was skeptical about this one, but was blown away by Giles Bowkett's presentation. From recounting his life adventures, including a &#8220;psycho throwing rocks at his dad until he threatened him with a piece of rebar&#8221; to calling venture capitalists &#8220;weasel-brained muppet fuckers… they're not fools, they're liars.&#8221;  He kept the crowd well entertained, but threw in some really interesting and well-delivered points about startups and life.  It is well worth watching.</p>
<p>Another one that really stood out was Ryan Davis' presentation about &#8220;Hurting code for fun and profit.&#8221; He had a lot of really great things to say about being a developer, so go watch it already!</p>
<p>These speakers helped me to become aware of a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't read enough.  Ryan mentioned that the average developer reads 1 book a year. Is one book a month really so hard?</li>
<li>I don't hurt my code enough.  I don't use flog or heckle consistently and I often don't take the time to correct code that I know should be improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>I definitely have some things to work on… how about you?</p>
