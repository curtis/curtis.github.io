<p>As I read my blog feeds, I will routinely save posts that I don't have time to read thoroughly, but would like to in the future.  Then I come back later (sometimes much later) and read them.</p>
<p>I just came across an article by <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/">Dick Costolo</a> titled simply <cite><a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/2007/02/company_culture.html">Company Culture</a></cite>.  He briefly examines why establishing a strong culture is important to a company.  He states that without a strong culture you might get some of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bureaucracy. Without an implicit understanding of how things work around here, everything has to be explicitly articulated, documented, and instructed.</li>
<li>Office politics. Companies with a very clear vibe or feel to them find that politics don't encroach on the landscape as quickly as companies without a distinct culture. Probably because people start sniping or backbiting when uncertainty and policy are the order of the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>He also talks about companies having a fake culture where leadership is trying to force a sense of spirit and excitement into the environment and everybody can sense that it's forced.</p>
<p>When it is just one or two people defining the culture for a very small team, things may be manageable.  When you have possibly hundreds of leaders in the company espousing their take on the culture it is a lot less manageable.  This is where politics and bureaucracy rear their ugly heads.</p>
<p>What about the situation where the company actually does have a strong culture, but the culture is not changing fast enough (or at all) and therefore, cannot retain top talent?  A culture that may ultimately be self-destructive?  For example, I believe that Google may be experience this as they struggle with becoming a large corporation.  I have read many articles claiming that entrepreneurial types are departing Google because of cultural differences.  Is this just the restless nature of the entrepreneur or an indication of a weakening culture?</p>
<p>Personally, I try to avoid bureaucracy.  As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Murray_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> said it's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission. I recently learned this the hard way and I won't make that mistake again anytime soon. As far as politics goes, I generally give it the finger and refuse to play. This can be hard sometimes when you feel your job may hinge on your ability to politically maneuver within the organization. I still think it is better to speak your mind, do what you feel is right, and not back down without a good reason.</p>
