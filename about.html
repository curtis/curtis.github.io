<p>
  I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and the co-founder of {{ site.company.name }}, a <a rel="external" href="{{ site.company.url }}">Ruby on Rails development</a> company. We work with early-stage startup companies, large enterprise organizations, and everything in-between.

  In addition to working as a software consulting company, we're also involved in the tech community through <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-AZ/">Ruby::AZ</a> and <a href="http://cohoots.com">CO+HOOTS coworking</a>.

  I love talking with startups about their ideas, so please get in touch!
