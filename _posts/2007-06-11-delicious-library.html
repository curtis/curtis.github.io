I have a new favorite application for the Mac called <a href="http://delicious-monster.com">Delicious Library</a>.  It is an application for cataloging, managing, and sharing your books, music, games, and movies.  It integrates with iCal and the AddressBook to make thing easier.  It also uses your iSight to scan the bar code on the back of the media, how cool is that?</p>

<p>Awesome!</p>
