<p>I recently acquired a book entitled <cite><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">The Zen of <span class="caps">CSS</span> Design</a></cite> by <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a> and <a href="http://molly.com">Molly E. Holzschlag</a>.  Being fairly new to <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> I am embarking on a journey to better my <span class="caps">CSS</span> understanding and skills.  I feel this is something that I am lacking and am interested to see the impact this book, and another I will write about soon, will have on me.  Maybe I will even develop my own stylesheet for this blogâ€¦</p>
<p>I also recently found <a href="http://blog.auinteractive.com/have-you-reached-css-zen-yet">this blog post</a> from AU Interactive talking about the 12 steps to reaching <span class="caps">CSS</span> Zen.  I think I am on number 12, but I also skipped number 8 (I generally tend not to scoff at other people's work) and number 11 (it <i>is</i> optional after all).  So now, I am pursuing number 12.  Wish me luck!</p>
