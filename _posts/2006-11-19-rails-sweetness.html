<p>I was recently adding addresses to my site data.  For example, a user may have a home address and/or work address, whereas a business may have a physical address and/or mailing address.  I wanted to have a single database table that held the information about an address since that seems pretty standard.  Not surprisingly, it was called <code>addresses</code>.</p>
<p>How then do you hook up your users and business with this common table?  Enter Rails single-table inheritance implementation.  Martin Fowler has a <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/singleTableInheritance.html">nice diagram</a> explaining the idea behind single table inheritance.  You basically take your modeled inheritance hierarchy and smash it into a single database table.</p>
<p>I added my address table, ensuring that it contained the magic field &#8216;type'.  The type column in the address table will automatically insert the class associated with the object being saved to the database.  <strong><em>This is key</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Next, I generated the Address model.  Along with the Address model, I also created some inheritance models:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
class Address < ActiveRecord::Base ; end

class BusinessAddress < Address ; end

class UserAddress < Address ; end

class UserHomeAddress < UserAddress ; end

class UserWorkAddress < UserAddress ; end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The inheritance hierarchy allows you to do things like finds within a particular branch of a hierarchy.  For instance, if we were to do a</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
UserAddress.find(:all)
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The results would be all UserAddress, UserHomeAddress, and UserWorkAddress entries in the database.</p>
<p>I then added a join table called users_addresses and connected a user to an address through a <code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code> relationship:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
has_and_belongs_to_many :useraddresses,
                        :class_name => 'UserAddress',
                        :join_table => 'users_addresses',
                        :foreign_key => "user_id",
                        :association_foreign_key => "address_id"
                        {% endhighlight %}

<p>If you wanted easier access to the addresses of the user, then just add a simple method to the User model.  For example, if you wanted the ability to get the home and work address like so</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
user = User.find(:first)
user.homeaddress
user.workaddress
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This could be accomplished by a few simple methods in the User model class:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
def homeaddress
  self.useraddresses.find(:first, :conditions => "type = 'UserHomeAddress'")
end

def workaddress
  self.useraddresses.find(:first, :conditions => "type = 'UserWorkAddress'")
end
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code>self.useraddresses</code> portion gets all of the UserAddress objects associated with this User id.  This means UserAddress, UserHomeAddress and UserWorkAddress objects.</p>
<p>There may be another way to do this, but this seems pretty freakin sweet to me.  this is also the tip of the iceberg with inheritance and I realize my prototype does not use it nearly enough.  Oh well, guess it can wait for refactoring. Here are a few other resources about <acronym title="Single Table Inheritance">STI</acronym>:</p>
