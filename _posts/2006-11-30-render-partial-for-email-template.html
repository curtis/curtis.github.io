title: Render Partial for Email Template
---
<p>As I create more automated email responses for my system, I realized I should follow the <span class="caps">DRY</span> (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  So I started down a path to create a separate file containing a header and footer for my emails.  At least that part I could rip out, right?  Wellâ€¦not exactly.</p>
<p>Turns out that rendering from within a mail template is not yet supported.  In fact there is a <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/2926">Rails ticket</a> open to address it, but it has not been corrected yet.</p>
<p>So, what to do?  A <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/59024">suggestion from the Ruby Forums</a> from the forums involves using a relative path when invoking render.  For example:</p>

{% highlight erb %}
<%= render :partial => '../foo' %>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Where &#8216;foo' refers to &#8216;_foo.rhtml' in the &#8216;app/views/' directory.  This seems to work for me, but apparently this is only a workaround.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be helpful to someone else who has the same problem.</p>
