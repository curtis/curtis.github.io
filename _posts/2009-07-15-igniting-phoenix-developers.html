<p>Did you know that Intel is hosting an <a rel="external" href="http://ignite.oreilly.com/">Ignite</a> style event on July 22nd? NO!?! Well, they are, so you'd better be there!</p>
<p>Ten great local developers are speaking, including <a rel="external" href="http://chrischandler.name">Chris Chandler</a> my partner at Flatterline. And there will be even more great local peeps in attendance cheering, or jeering (nicely), them on as they talk for 5 minutes each. If you've been to an <a rel="external" href="http://ignite-phoenix.org">Ignite Phoenix</a> event then you know how hard this can be.</p>
<p>Get more details from the <a rel="external" href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/developer-ignite/">Intel Developer Ignite</a> post and please RSVP <a href="mailto:developerignite@intel.com?subject=RSVP">by email</a> or through <a rel="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=135388710280">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Wait, did I mention there will be food and tasty alcoholic beverages? But only if you RSVP. See you there, Phoenix!</p>
