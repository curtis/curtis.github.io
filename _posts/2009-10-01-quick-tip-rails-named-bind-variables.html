title: "Quick Tip: Rails Named Bind Variables"
---
<p>Have you ever come across a Ruby on Rails query that has so many conditions that it's hard to figure out what is being replaced where? While this can be somewhat mitigated by using <a href="https://millarian.com/rails/quick-tip-named_scope/">Rails named scopes</a>, you can also use named bind variables to make it easier to read. Named bind variables replace the question marks with symbols and you supply a hash with values for the matching symbol keys:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
Company.find(:first, :conditions => [
  "state = :state AND name = :name AND division = :division AND created_at > :some_date",
  { :state => :approved, :name => '{{ site.company.name }}', :division => 'First', :some_date => '2009-02-27' }
])
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is also very handy when you have the same value for multiple parameters, since it will replace all matching bind variables with the value (e.g., the current time).</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
Event.find(:first, :conditions => [
  "state = :state AND starts_at <= :now AND ends_at >= :now",
  { :state => :active, :now => Time.zone.now }
])
{% endhighlight %}
