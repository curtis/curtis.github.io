  <a href="http://matthewgist.com">Matt Gist</a> tagged me as part of &#8220;The 6th Meme&#8221; and challenged me to post the 6th photo of the 6th page of <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/curtm95">my Flickr</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Over the summer, my dad (the big guy pictured) and I did some work on my backyard. In this picture, we're laying the header for the brick patio. Where I'm mixing the concrete in the wheelbarrow became the patio and where my dad is walking became grass. Now that the patio is done, the kids have a great time riding their bikes on the patio, drawing all over the bricks with chalk and playing soccer in the grass.
