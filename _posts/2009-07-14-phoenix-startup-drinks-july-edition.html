<p>It appears that the <a rel="external" href="http://phoenix.startupdrinks.com">Phoenix Startup Drinks</a> site has been down for a few hours. I wish I could fix it, but that's not something I have control over. As this is an international movement, every city is subdomained as part of the same Wordpress MU installation. Never fear though, I've contacted the people in charge... In the meantime, I've duplicated the information for the first Phoenix Startup Drinks here.</p>
<p>Also, if you write a post, take pictures, video, etc. please <strong>use the tag #phxsd</strong>. Thanks!</p>
